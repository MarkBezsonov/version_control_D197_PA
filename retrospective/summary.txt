Merge Conflict Resolution (Nov 29th 2023)
-----------------------------------------
Issue was resolved by overwriting the Student ID portion of the README.md file from the 'test' branch with the Git Version portion of the README.md
file from the 'working' branch as this information better pertains to the project (the Student ID may also potentially be PII and thus a potential risk).

Improvement Revisions:
----------------------
- contact.html: Our team discussed the original comedic approach here and thought that our clients deserved some proper customer service in light of
the company's growth. This page now renders both an apology as well as where clients can go in order to obtain help.
- home.html: Added a fourth option to the list - more details pertaining to this decision will be disclosed in Q1 2024 but, for now, this option remains
as a backlog item in order to build some suspense for our clients...
- index.html: After numerous requests from clients, our product team decided to move forward with updating our edible offerings to match our popular 'Ahi
Tuna Steak' offering. We expect this to increase site traffic by 13% in Q1 alone!
